#Occursum
This is the repository for Occursum, the app I have written for my Mobile App Development project. It consists of a basic contact managing 
app that includes some extra features like notes on what a person does and doesn't like to help with networking. This can allow the user to 
improve at making smalltalk and at building better relationships with theire jmanagers and possibly representitives in other companies that 
could be usefull in future. Like the saying goes: "Its not what you know that matters, but who you know."
